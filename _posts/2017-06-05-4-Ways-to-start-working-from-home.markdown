Working remote is becoming mainstream. Forbes explained [the benefits of working from home](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/12/18/benefits-working-from-home/#425ebf131d4c) and aspiring pictures of beautiful nature-centered offices are popping up everywhere. <!--more--> Being working nomads ourselves, we can only encourage you to take the leap.

### Here are 4 ways on how to start working from home today.

### 1. Ask your current employer if you can work remotely.
You’ll never know if you don’t ask. Suggest starting with 1 day per week and mention that you can easily go back to normal if it doesn't work out. Your boss will be more inclined to allow working from home if it doesn't sound permanent.
Many employers know the benefits of working from home bur if your boss needs some convincing, be sure to mention the benefits of the Forbes article I linked earlier. Make them understand that hours spend don't directly relate to the qualitative of work.
Ask if you may proof working at home will deliver better quality work.

**TIP:** Tim Ferris, author of “The 4-Hour Workweek” and “Tools of Titans”, tested many different productivity tools. We love: [The email game](http://www.emailga.me/) , [Jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/) and the [Pomodoro Technique](http://e.ggtimer.com/).

### 2. Apply at a company that supports working remotely
Ever more companies provide job positions specifically for people working from home.

They checked over 40,000 companies and lists all their ‘working from home job vacancies'. Definitely [check it out](https://www.flexjobs.com/company-guide).

### 3. Become a freelancer
The success of websites like [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/), [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com) and [fivver.com](https://www.fiverr.com/) show how big the freelancer market is and provide great examples of people earning a living while working from home.
No boudt you have a talent that someone is willing to pay for. Very popular work on these website is translating, content writing, photoshop, social media management and online marketing.
You might get some really cool projects in Paris or Cape Town. We have to warn you though that competition on these websites is quite high. As freelancers work from anywhere in the world, hourly rates vary greatly. 
The best approach to building credibility is to take many tests that proof your value and start at a low rate for a few months to build up reviews. We do see that once you have a happy customer, they tend to come back with similar projects.

### 4. Start your own online store
In theory for many this seems the most appealing option. There are numerous examples out there of a stay at home mom starting a small online store selling the things she makes as a hobby and eventually blowing her revenue through the roof. 
Although these success stories make you want to believe in fairy tales, having an online store can come with a lot of stress and issues so do your research.
Once you decide to create an online store you need to think about stock levels, logistics and returns, accounting, customer service, etc. At Jaswig, we have used Shopify for almost 2 years now and it has proven to be a great and reliable partner.
Even though it's just one of many great platforms that helps you create and manage an online store. We highly recommend it.
If you need help with starting and running your online store [the eCommerceFuel Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/ecommercefuel-build-launch/id679570743?mt=2) is a good guide through the steps.
