Working remote is becoming mainstream. Forbes explained [the benefits of working from home](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/12/18/benefits-working-from-home/#425ebf131d4c) and aspiring pictures of beautiful nature-centered offices are popping up everywhere.
Being working nomads ourselves, we can only encourage you to take the leap.

**Here are 4 ways on how to start working from home today.**


![Working-from-home](/images/blog/Working-from-home.jpg)


### 1. Ask your current employer if you can work remotely.
You’ll never know what's possible if you don’t ask. Suggest starting with 1 day per week and mention that you can easily go back to normal if it doesn't work out. Your boss will be more inclined to allow working from home if it doesn't sound permanent.
Many employers know the benefits of working from home and care enough about the productivity of their employees to be open to the idea. If your boss needs some convincing, be sure to mention the benefits of the Forbes article I linked above.
Usually employers prefer you to work in the office so they can monitor your hours better but it's your responsability to make them understand that your hours spend don't directly relate to the amount of qualitative work.
Ask if you may proof that you will be more productive at home and will deliver better quality work in less hours. Don’t hesitate to increase the days you work from home once you have proven to deliver.
TIP: To increase your productivity while working from home, Tim Ferris, author of “The 4-Hour Workweek” and “Tools of Titans”, has tested many different productivity tools. The ones we use the most are: [The email game](http://www.emailga.me/) , [Jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/) and the [Pomodoro Technique](http://e.ggtimer.com/).

### 2. Apply at a company that supports working remotely
Ever more companies provide job positions specifically for people working from home. You may have seen adds on the Internet or subway promising remote or flexible work but those aren’t always legitimate.
If you want to find a legitimate job at a good company that supports working from home your best bet is [flexjobs.com](www.flexjobs.com). 
Flexjobs.com checked over 40,000 companies and lists all their ‘working from home job vacancies'. Definitely [check it out](https://www.flexjobs.com/company-guide).
Alternatively, there are many options out there, just pick and choose: [Working Nomads](https://www.workingnomads.co/jobs), [The Remote Working Company](http://www.remoteworking.co/), [Remote OK](https://remoteok.io/), [DigitalNomad JobFinder](http://digitalnomad-jobfinder.com/), [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/), and [RemoteBase](https://remotebase.io/).

The top ranking ‘working from home jobs’ are in computer and IT. Also high on the list are government, finance, customer service, marketing and sales. Plenty to choose from.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDgckuEAqLQ) is a youtube video on how to stay organized while working from home.

### 3. Become a freelancer
The success of websites like [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/), [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com) and [fivver.com](https://www.fiverr.com/) show how big the freelancer market is and provide great examples of people earning a living while working from home or exotic islands.
No boudt you have some valuable experience that someone is willing to pay for. Very popular work on these website is translating, content writing, photoshop, social media management and online marketing.
It's fun to know that these websites have customers from all over the world so you might get some really cool projects for a person or company in Paris or Cape Town. We have to warn you though that competition on these websites is quite high. As freelancer you can work from anywhere in the world, hourly rates vary greatly. 
The best approach to this is to take many tests that proof your value and start at a low rate for a few months to build up a great score through reviews. We do see that once you have a customer that is happy, they tend to come back with similar projects and stick with you as long as you do a good job.  

### 4. Start your own online store
In theory for many this seems the most appealing option of all. There are numerous examples out there of a stay at home mom starting a small online store selling the things she makes as a hobby and eventually blowing her revenue through the roof. 
Although these success stories make you want to believe in fairy tales, having an online store can come with a lot of stress and issues.
Once you decide to create an online store you need to think about stock levels, logistics and returns, accounting, customer service, etc. At Jaswig we have been using Shopify for almost 2 yearsn now and it has proven to be a great and reliable system.
Even though it's just one of many great platforms that helps you create and manage an online store. We highly recommend it.
If you need help with starting and running your online store [the eCommerceFuel Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/ecommercefuel-build-launch/id679570743?mt=2) is a good guide through the steps.
