### Highly interesting books, movies and articles

Great books, movies, articles and locations that were extremely important in shaping our thoughts and vision. So important that we couldn’t resist sharing them!

Why do we do what we do? What is our legacy? Why is our economy shifting towards a sharing economy (of which co-working spaces are an example) with purpose as a place to start?
