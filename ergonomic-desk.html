      <p>Today, many employers and professionals are investing in an <strong>ergonomic desk,</strong> or something similar, to boost health and performance. Jaswig has developed an ergonomic standing desk collection designed to maximize productivity and minimize the health risks associated with a sedentary office lifestyle. With sustainable business practices and a top quality product, Jaswig looks forward to transforming how you view your daily work life.</p>

      <h2>The Science Behind An Ergonomic Standing Desk</h2>

      <p>Ergonomics is the study of how people work within their environments. A popular idea is that people can reduce the risk of injury and improve productivity levels when they use safer work practices. For those who sit at a desk on a regular basis, taking account of ergonomics might be changing the type of chair, type of desk, or behaviors demonstrated during a workday. Switching to ergonomic standing desks can reduce many health risks associated with office work.</p>

      <p>At Jaswig, we have developed an ergonomic desk collection to adjust to a user's individual needs. Whether you are short, tall, or medium height, you can adjust your Extra Wide or compact StandUp Nomad to fit your particular body size. Also, a strategically placed footrest on the ergonomic standing desk allows individuals to change positions as needed. Part of <a href="http://www.jaswig.com/our-story/">our mission</a> is to provide our customers with a workspace that will benefit their health and happiness every day.</p>

      <p>If you find yourself sitting in the same position day after day, an ergonomic desk may provide the answer you have been looking for. When you invest in an ergonomic standing desk, the negative symptoms of a sedentary lifestyle can be reduced, including fatigue, soreness, stiffness, and much more.

      <h3>Ergonomic Desks For Employers</h3>

      <p>Employers and employees both play an important role in creating a health-conscious work environment. Using an ergonomic standing desk, office workers can implement best practices when they sit at their desk or stand for long periods of time. Employers can invest in products that improve employee comfort levels, and encourage them to stand instead of sit. For example, an ergonomic desk can be a major step toward reducing the risk of chronic illness and daily fatigue.</p>

      <p>If you are an employer looking for ergonomic desks, consider these benefits of an ergonomic standing office workstation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved flexibility.</strong> An ergonomic desk such as the Jaswig StandUp Nomad allows employees to make their work environments portable. From the office or cubicle to a flex meeting space, an ergonomic standing desk allows employees to take their desks wherever they feel most comfortable and productive.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced injury and illness.</strong> When employees call out sick or file for worker’s compensation due to workplace conditions, employees and employers both lose out. Employers who invest in their employees’ health, safety, and wellness into the future can reduce downtime and also cut costs with our products. An ergonomic standing desk will help employees feel good, and perform better on a daily basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved creativity.</strong> Often times, change encourages creativity. An ergonomic desk may give employees the opportunity to pursue innovative ideas. Whether you are investing in an ergonomic environment for your marketing team or your support staff, these types of changes often lead to productive outcomes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Consider placing an order for your desk as an investment. An ergonomic office environment can increase productivity and lead to a great return on investment. If you are interested in how to overhaul your work environment for less, ergonomic standing desks may provide the best solution.</p>

      <h3>Features Of The Jaswig StandUp Nomad Desk</h3>

      <p>The ergonomic desk and work environment is an idea that is currently trending. Many office suppliers provide desks that they claim will improve employee productivity and reduce overhead costs. At Jaswig, we recognize the needs of different individuals in terms of ergonomics. Our StandUp Nomad ergonomic desks are designed to match these specific requirements. Each user can set his or her desktop at the appropriate level for maximum comfort. Made from high-quality birch wood and produced sustainably, every individual or company can feel confident when choosing an ergonomic workstation from Jaswig.</p>

      <p>We currently offer three timeless desk styles, designed with ergonomics in mind:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Extra Wide StandUp Nomad.</strong> This desk provides a slightly larger desktop environment for those who plan to rely heavily on their ergonomic desks. Only $50 more than our compact design, this desk is perfect for any work environment and can accommodate computer work, artistic design, and a wide range of other activities.</li>
        <li><strong>StandUp Nomad.</strong> Our classic design is excellent for anyone interested in a portable work environment. Everyone wants flexibility in the workplace, and this is exactly what the StandUp Nomad provides. Use these desks in the office environment, or anywhere else with the use of a portable computer. The investment is beneficial in terms of ergonomics and space, and these desks provide a good solution for a stagnant workplace.</li>
        <li><strong>My First StandUp.</strong> This is the child-sized version of the larger Nomad desks. These adjustable desks allow children to stand instead of sit while working, helping them develop positive habits while completing their homework, using the computer, or engaging in creative endeavors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each desk features the same solid wood construction and kitchen cabinet grade finish for durability. With an easy-to-assemble construction process and a spacious and functional desktop, you will love the universal appeal of our high quality product. Every ergonomic standing desk Jaswig offers comes with a footrest. We encourage all of our users to step one foot on he footrest and change positions while using the StandUp Nomad or the My First StandUp desk. This is a great solution to the fatigue that can sometimes set in if you are not used to standing for prolonged periods.</p>
