			<h3>Benefits Of Using Adjustable Standing Desks</h3>

			<p>Shockingly, the average office worker <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/02/medical-researchers-have-figured-out-how-much-time-is-okay-to-spend-sitting-each-day/?utm_term=.ab65011b30d1" target="_blank">sits for about 10 hours each day. </a> Now, the merits of adjustable height desks might be more apparent to you. Of course, an adjustable desk is not a miracle cure for a sedentary lifestyle, but it can reduce the health risks associated with a person who is likely to sit for a prolonged period of time. When you sit for more time than necessary at a desk that is not adjustable, your spine can sink into a slouched position, and body-wide circulation will be compromised.</p>

			<p>Sedentary lifestyles are associated with an increased risk of cancer, chronic diseases, and premature mortality. Exercise and nutrition can reduce risk, but many need even more of a change, such as being able to stand at an ergonomic adjustable desk, to best protect their health. When combined with other health-conscious practices, a height adjustable desk can improve circulation, promote better posture while standing, and keep muscles and joints engaged. Our desks have more benefits than you might think.</p>

			<p>Over time, the user of an adjustable desk will notice distinct benefits, including:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Improved concentration.</strong> Standing at adjustable desks can improve energy levels, combat the afternoon slump, and keep individuals focused on the task at hand.</li>
				<li><strong>Improved health.</strong> Moving around and standing at an adjustable height desk can keep your blood flowing and improve muscle activity. Over time, you may notice that you stand a little taller and your core is a little tighter. Users can consciously engage their muscles while they stand to enhance the benefits of a height adjustable desk.</li>
				<li><strong>Improved productivity.</strong> As you grow accustomed to standing for phone calls, email management, and other activities, you may start to notice the ability to work faster, smarter, and more comfortably. Ergonomic adjustable height desks that allow you to stand may improve your overall satisfaction with office work that is otherwise sedentary.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Naturally, individual results of using a height adjustable desk will vary, but activities that encourage muscle engagement, like standing, will certainly improve health. Jaswig adjustable height desks are extremely versatile pieces of furniture, and they can serve several purposes in the home or office setting. When you use our height adjustable desks you will see improvement in terms of health and convenience each day, and we know you will feel great about your workspace.</p>

			<h3>Best Practices For Using Your Jaswig Ergonomic Adjustable Desks</h3>

			<p>Knowing how to use your Jaswig height adjustable desk is very important in order to see optimal results. The ergonomic design of our products, once adjusted, leads to a high quality personal experience when standing for daily activities. Take advantage of these tips to get the most out of our products:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Adjust the desk height accordingly.</strong> Follow the instructions in your manual for setting your adjustable desk to the appropriate height to stand or sit. These recommendations will help you get the best possible results while you stand at your desks.</li>
				<li><strong>Start slow.</strong> Like any new activity, avoid trying to constantly stand after you assemble your adjustable desk. At first, try to stand for 30-minute increments, and sit for the rest of the time. Increase the amount of time you stand, and decrease time you sit as your body adjusts to the new position. You have been used to sitting at desks, so take your time when transitioning.</li>
				<li><strong>Use the footrest and invest in an <a href="https://store.jaswig.com/products/standon" target="_blank">anti-fatigue mat.</a></strong> Change positions frequently to keep your knees from locking and your feet from growing uncomfortable. A foam mat can also increase comfort when standing at desks during the day. Remember to always wear comfortable shoes when you plan to stand at your adjustable desk for long periods of time.</li>
