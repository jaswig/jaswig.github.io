      <p>If you are experiencing fatigue, soreness, back ache, or other symptoms from sitting at a desk or table for a prolonged period of time, consider investing in a Jaswig <strong>height adjustable desk.</strong> At Jaswig, we specialize in making high-quality standing desks that can improve productivity and reduce feelings of pain and soreness. We design our products based on personal experience, the science of ergonomics, and our honest love for sustainable business.</p>

		<h2>An Assortment Of High-Quality Adjustable Desks</h2>

		<p>The team at Jaswig believes in the power of making health-conscious decisions everyday. Not everyone can stand up from their computer and walk around at regular intervals. However, with a strategically designed height adjustable desk, you will be able to sit or stand whenever you choose, and still maintain high levels of productivity. You will also experience the valuable health benefits associated with a more active lifestyle.</p>

		<p>Currently, we offer three different styles of adjustable desks:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>StandUp Nomad, Extra Wide.</strong> As the largest height adjustable desks we offer, the Extra Wide StandUp Nomad features a table top size of 21.5 x 31.5 inches. This desk is ideal for setting up a desktop computer with a riser and monitor or a laptop setup with an additional keyboard and mouse. For an individual who enjoys having space for paperwork, movement, and other activities, this desk offers everything you need from a traditional sit down desk in a standing height adjustable desk format.</li>
		<li><strong>StandUp Nomad.</strong> Our compact standing desks are ideal for taking your work on the go. At home and in the workplace, the StandUp Nomad delivers an adjustable desk experience while taking up minimal space. Check email on your laptop, read a book, or catch up on the latest news with these versatile standing desks. Measuring slightly smaller than the Extra Wide version, this design features a table top surface of 20 x 25.5 inches.</li>
		<li><strong>My First StandUp.</strong> Unlike many of our competitors, Jaswig offers a youth-sized adjustable desk. This smaller version of the Nomad series adjusts to heights between 27 and 35 inches. These desks allow children to burn energy standing as they complete homework, use a laptop, or engage in other recreational activities.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Each Jaswig desk features a simple mechanism for adjusting the height of the table top. Simply pull the legs of the desktop out of their grooves and raise or lower the desk height as needed. A minimalist footrest allows users to adjust their positions when standing for improved flexibility and minimal fatigue. Our solid wood desks fit well into any office or residential setting and are equipped with a kitchen cabinet grade coating for improved durability. Jaswig desks are extremely high quality products, and you will experience the difference whenever you put one of them to use.</p>

	<h3>Benefits Of Using A Standing Desk</h3>

	<p>Shockingly, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/02/medical-researchers-have-figured-out-how-much-time-is-okay-to-spend-sitting-each-day/">the average office worker sits for nearly 10 hours each day.</a> Of course, an adjustable desk is not a miracle cure for a sedentary lifestyle, but it can reduce the health risks associated with a person who is likely to sit for a prolonged period of time. When you sit for more time than necessary, your spine can sink into a slouched position, and body-wide circulation will be compromised.</p>

	<p>Sedentary lifestyles are associated with an increased risk of cancer, chronic diseases, and premature mortality. Exercise and nutrition can reduce risk, but many need even more of a change to best protect their health. When combined with other health-conscious practices, a height adjustable desk can improve circulation, promote better posture while standing, and keep muscles and joints engaged.</p>

	<p>Over time, the user of an adjustable desk will notice distinct benefits, including:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Improved concentration.</strong> Standing can improve energy levels, combat the afternoon slump, and keep individuals focused on the task at hand.</li>
		<li><strong>Improved health.</strong> Moving around and standing at an adjustable height desk can keep your blood flowing and improve muscle activity. Over time, you may notice that you stand a little taller and your core is a little tighter. Users can consciously engage their muscles while they stand to enhance the benefits of a height adjustable desk.</li>
		<li><strong>Improved productivity.</strong> As you grow accustomed to standing for phone calls, email management, and other activities, you may start to notice the ability to work faster, smarter, and more comfortably. An adjustable height desk that allows you to stand may improve your overall satisfaction with work that is otherwise sedentary.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Naturally, individual results of using a height adjustable desk will vary, but activities that encourage muscle engagement, like standing, will certainly improve health. A Jaswig adjustable height desk is an extremely versatile piece of furniture, and it can serve several purposes in the home or office setting. When you use our product you will see improvement in terms of health and convenience each day, and we know you will feel great about your workspace.</p>

	<h3>Best Practices For Using Your Jaswig Desk</h3>

	<p>Knowing how to use your Jaswig height adjustable desk is very important in order to see optimal results. The ergonomic design of our products, once adjusted, leads to a high quality personal experience when standing for daily activities. Take advantage of these tips to get the most out of our products:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Adjust the desk height accordingly.</strong> Follow the instructions in your manual for adjusting your desk to the appropriate height to stand or sit. These recommendations will help you get the best possible results out of your desk.</li>
		<li><strong>Start slow.</strong> Like any new activity, avoid trying to constantly stand after you assemble your adjustable desk. At first, try to stand for 30-minute increments, and sit for the rest of the time. Increase the amount of time you stand, and decrease time you sit as your body adjusts to the new position.</li>
		<li><strong>Use the footrest and invest in an <a href="https://us-store.jaswig.com/products/standon">anti-fatigue mat.</a></strong> Change positions frequently to keep your knees from locking and your feet from growing uncomfortable. A foam mat can also increase comfort when standing during the day. Remember to always wear comfortable shoes when you plan to stand at your desk for long periods of time.</li>
	</ol>
