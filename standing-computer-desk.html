      <h3>What Makes Jaswig’s Standing Computer Desk Different?</h3>

      <p>Adjustable standing desks are trending in the office space today. Many big-box stores, furniture suppliers, and office supply stores carry some version of a standing computer desk. However, these desks are basic pieces of furniture that do not have the specific ergonomic design that Jaswig desks do. Most other desks are not designed for individual users. However, a Jaswig standing computer desk is highly customizable, and our desks are  made from sustainable resources. These factors set our adjustable standing desks apart from competing products. View our product selection in the <a href="http://www.jaswig.com/store/">Jaswig shop</a> .</p>

      <p>Each adjustable Jaswig desk is built from high quality birch. We spend time working on the ergonomic design of our desks to ensure every user experiences the same level of comfort and flexibility while they stand. We have not only built a great piece of office furniture, but we have also built a solution that allows you to stand instead of sit at your computer or in the office.</p>

      <p>When you purchase an adjustable standing desk from Jaswig, you can feel confident in your investment. Our team has made a conscious choice to forego mass production.

      <h3>Get More Out Of Your Standing Computer Desk</h3>

      <p>A standing computer desk is a valuable tool in both the home and office workspace. You can stand while you maximize comfort and happiness in the office, engaging your muscles with our StandUp Nomad desks. Below are some of our best tips for achieving great results using a standing desk:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Change positions frequently.</strong> Move around while you are standing at your desks to keep your muscles and joints from getting stiff or sore. Each Jaswig standing desk features an ergonomic footrest. In addition to the built in foot prop, an anti-fatigue mat can also keep your feet from tiring out as you stand at our desks. Always wear comfortable shoes while you stand at our desks to get the most out of your working experience.</li>

        <li><strong>Do not lock your knees.</strong> Many of us develop a bad habit of locking our knees while standing. Doing so may affect circulation flowing to the brain and increase the risk of fainting. Instead, try to keep your knees bent gently as you stand at your desks.</li>

        <li><strong>Do not force the experience.</strong> We strongly advise users of our desks to build up to long-term standing sessions. When you begin using our desks, consider setting a timer for 30 minutes or one hour to stand. After that time, go back to sitting for a short while. Stand for longer periods of time each day to build up your strength and gain maximum benefit from your standing desk experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A standing computer desk can energize you and greatly improve your daily living experience. Being able to stand and move your body on a regular basis can be a benefit to your health, especially during prolonged and usually sedentary activities. You will come to appreciate being able to remain standing while you use the computer, read, or play.
