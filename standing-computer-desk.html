      <h3>What Makes Jaswig’s Standing Computer Desk Different?</h3>

      <p>Standing desks are trending in the office space today. Many big-box stores, furniture suppliers, and office supply stores carry some version of a standing computer desk. However, these desks are basic pieces of furniture that do not have the specific ergonomic design that Jaswig desks do. Most other desks are not designed for individual users. However, a Jaswig standing computer desk is highly customizable and made from sustainable resources. These factors set our adjustable standing desks apart from competing products.</p>

      <p>Each portable Jaswig desk is built from high quality birch. We spend time working on the ergonomic design to ensure every user experiences the same level of comfort and flexibility. We have not only built a great piece of office furniture, but we have also built a solution to a depressing, unhealthy workspace.</p>

      <p>When you purchase an adjustable standing desk from Jaswig, you can feel confident in your investment. Our team has made a conscious choice to forego mass production. Rather, we work with local manufacturers and choose environmentally sustainable distribution routes. When you place an order for any Jaswig products, you can rest assured that your money is supporting the local economy.

      <h3>Get More Out Of Your Standing Computer Desk</h3>

      <p>A standing computer desk is a valuable tool in both home and office life. You can maximize your comfort and happiness in the office, engaging your muscles with our StandUp Nomad desks. Below are some of our best tips for achieving great results using a standing desk:</p>

      <ul>
      	<li><strong>Change positions frequently.</strong> Move around while you are standing to keep your muscles and joints from getting stiff or sore. Each Jaswig standing desk features an ergonomic footrest. In addition to the built in foot prop, an anti-fatigue mat can also keep your feet from tiring out as you stand. Always wear comfortable shoes while you stand to get the most out of your working experience.</li>

      	<li><strong>Do not lock your knees.</strong> Many of us develop a bad habit of locking our knees while standing. Doing so may affect circulation flowing to the brain and increase the risk of fainting. Instead, try to keep your knees bent gently as you stand at your workstations.</li>

      	<li><strong>Do not force the experience.</strong> We strongly advise users to build up to long-term standing sessions. When you begin, consider setting a timer for 30 minutes or one hour. After that time, go back to sitting for a short while. Stand for longer periods of time each day to build up your strength and gain maximum benefit from your standing desk experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A standing computer desk can energize you and greatly improve your daily living experience. Moving your body on a regular basis can work wonders for health, especially during prolonged and usually sedentary activities. You will come to appreciate being able to remain standing while you work, read, or play. By utilizing Jaswig standing workstations, you can experience the benefits of the ability to stand upright at your desktop or laptop computer. This gives you the power to complete job tasks without feeling the negative effects that come from being forced to sit down for an extended period of time.</p>
