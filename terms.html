       <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) apply to the purchasers of any and all products (“Products”) manufactured and sold by JASWIG® llc (“Jaswig”) and to any and all users of this website. The purchaser of the Products (“Purchaser”) and user of the website agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. </p>
       
         <p><strong>Here’s what our product does.</strong></p>
       <p>Jaswig provides Purchaser with a height adjustable standing desk and possibly other products. The desks provide furniture for an active lifestyle and can be used at home, in the office, and in the classroom. </p>
       
       <p><strong>All Products manufactured by Jaswig will be used according to these safety instructions.</strong></p>
       <p>These safety instructions are intended not only for the protection of the desk, but also to protect the safety of yourself and others. Jaswig’s standing desk products are not heavy duty working surfaces, chairs, or toys. Jaswig’s desks are elevated surfaces used to support light weight study or work materials. Improper use of the desk can cause serious injury and/or property damage. In the case of improper use, a desk can be dangerous. Use every reasonable precaution possible when using the desk. Jaswig does not guarantee error-free products, including without limitation to its structural stability and height adjustment system. The desks need correct on-site assembly according to the assembly manual found at www.jaswig.com in order to be acceptable for use.  </p>
        <p>Proper use of the desk is limited to supporting proper desk materials such as books, paper, pens and pencils, laptops, computers and other educational tools, absolutely not exceeding a total of 20lbs (9kg). Always lock the locking bar of the desk when in use. Improper use of the desk includes and is not limited to: not locking the desk when in use, sitting, standing or hanging on the desk, pushing the desk over, putting two feet on the footrest, rocking the desk back and forth, drawing and/or carving on the desktop, placing hot objects on the surface, setting on fire, using outdoors, and more.</p>
        
         <p><strong>Purchaser uses all Products at his/her own risk.</strong></p>

           <p>After a Product has been delivered to the Purchaser, if Purchaser believes that the entire Product is defective, Purchaser shall contact Jaswig at standup@jaswig.com within 7 days of delivery and file a return application with a detailed description and pictures of the defects.

If Jaswig accepts the returned product, Jaswig will refund the full amount paid by the Purchaser within 30 days of accepting the return. The return shipping cost will be covered by Purchaser. Jaswig holds the right at any time to reject the return and not refund the Purchaser.
